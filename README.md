## Genetic Algorithm Maze Solver

This Python code is a maze-solving example using genetic algorithms. In this example, a turtle (or a ninja turtle) is placed in a maze with the objective of finding a pizza slice (represented as the exit). The turtle's genes encode a sequence of instructions for it to navigate through the maze. The turtle can move in four directions: left, right, up, and down.

The code uses the DEAP library for genetic algorithm implementation and Matplotlib for visualizing the maze and the turtle's progress.

### How It Works

1. **Generate a Maze**: The code generates a random maze with walls, a starting position (blue), and an exit position (red). You can adjust the maze size and block density as needed.

2. **Create Individuals**: Each individual in the population is represented as a sequence of instructions (genes) for the turtle to navigate the maze. The genome length and instructions are randomized within specified limits.

3. **Evaluate Fitness**: The fitness function assesses how well an individual performs in solving the maze. It considers factors like reaching the exit, avoiding walls, and not retracing steps. Fitness is determined based on a combination of distance to the exit and penalties for hitting walls and retracing steps.

4. **Genetic Operators**: The genetic algorithm uses standard genetic operators:
   - Crossover (mate): Two individuals exchange genetic information to create offspring.
   - Mutation: Randomly modify an individual's instructions.
   - Selection: Choose the best individuals to create the next generation.

5. **Run Genetic Algorithm**: The genetic algorithm evolves the population over a specified number of generations. It aims to find the best sequence of instructions that leads the turtle to the exit.

6. **Visualize the Maze**: The code visualizes the maze and the turtle's progress using Matplotlib. It saves frames of the turtle's movements for each individual in separate directories.

7. **Best Individual**: After running the algorithm, the best individual (turtle with the best instructions) is identified.

### Usage

To use this code, you can follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed, including DEAP, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

2. Set the desired parameters, such as maze size and genetic algorithm settings, in the code.

3. Run the code. It will generate a maze, evolve a population of turtles, and save frames of the best individual's progress in maze_animation_frames folders.

4. You can create an animation from the saved frames to visualize the turtle's journey through the maze.
